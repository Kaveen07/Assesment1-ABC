                    <h3>Let us show you why? Because of the Sri Lankan education system and the attitudes of parents,
                        children are pushed to follow the almost pre-defined path to obtain a degree qualification.
                        Hence, all the higher educational institutes including private and state universities are ready
                        to offer a degree qualification for you after completing about 40 academic subjects. But, it is
                        pretty obvious that there is a huge gap in skills and knowledge of a student who has been just
                        graduated in the IT field and the factual IT industry out there. Therefore, 90% of the degree
                        holders are reluctant to enter into the IT industry or rejected by the IT industry even they
                        have been recognized by their degree qualifications.</h3>
